My phone says connected, but audio doesn’t come through the headphones until I disconnect and reconnect at least two or three times. You can imagine how annoying this gets. Once properly connected it’s smooth sailing, but it’s always a bit of a headache at the beginning which wasn’t an issue when I first got these headphones.",
